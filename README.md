Example of a union find algorithm in Haskell.

Usage:

    app < input

where the first line of `input` contains the number of sets
and the subsequent lines are words which are equivalent.

Example:

    6
    dog cat 
    cat gerbil
    snake
    lion tiger
    bear lion
    gerbil hamster mouse

There are 6 sets of words, each of the following 6 lines is a set of equivalent words.

The program outputs the merged equivalence classes.
